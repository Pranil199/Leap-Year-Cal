# Leap-Year-Cal
#### 1. Modules to Install

This code uses only built-in Python functions and doesn't require any additional modules or libraries to be installed. It relies solely on Python's basic functionality for handling input and performing conditional logic.

#### 2. What Does the Code Do?

This code determines whether a given year is a leap year or not.

— Leap Year: A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4. However, if the year is also divisible by 100, it is not a leap year unless it is also divisible by 400.

#### 3. How the Code Works

1. User Input:
   — The code starts by asking the user to enter a year. This year is read as an integer value.

2. Leap Year Calculation:
   — The code checks if the entered year is a leap year using specific rules:
     — Rule 1: If the year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, it is a leap year.
     — Rule 2: If the year is divisible by 400, it is also a leap year.
   — These conditions are combined using logical operators to decide if the year qualifies as a leap year.

3. Output:
   — If the conditions for a leap year are met, the code prints a message stating that the year is a leap year.
   — If the conditions are not met, it prints a message stating that the year is not a leap year.

This script is used to determine if a specific year is a leap year by:

— Asking the user to input a year.
— Checking if the year meets the criteria for being a leap year.
— Displaying the result based on whether the year meets the leap year conditions.
